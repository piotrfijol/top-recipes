# [TOP] Recipes project

Small project that serves me as a quick refresher on HTML knowledge.  
  
## Description

Project's main goal is to create a few webpages and link them together.  
Everything has to be done using pure HTML which is a great opportunity to work on writing semantic code and therefore, accessibility.
  
## Summary

- Create webpages (One per recipe)
- Link webpages together in index.html file
- HTML only
